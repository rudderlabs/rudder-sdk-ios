# What is Rudder?

**Short answer:** 
Rudder is an open-source Segment alternative written in Go, built for the enterprise.

**Long answer:** 
Rudder is a platform for collecting, storing and routing customer event data to dozens of tools. Rudder is open-source, can run in your cloud environment (AWS, GCP, Azure or even your data-centre) and provides a powerful transformation framework to process your event data on the fly.

## Installation
Rudder is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). 
To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
```xcode
pod 'Rudder', '1.0.3'
```
Remember to include the following code in all `.m` and `.h` files where you want to refer to or use Rudder SDK classes
```xcode
#import <Rudder/Rudder.h>
```

## Initialize Client
Now initialize `RSClient`
Put this code in your `AppDelegate.m` file under the method `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`

```xcode
RSConfigBuilder *builder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];
[builder withDataPlaneUrl:<DATA_PLANE_URL>];
[RSClient getInstance:<WRITE_KEY> config:[builder build]];
```
A shared instance of `RSClient` is accesible after the initialization by `[RSClient sharedInstance]`
